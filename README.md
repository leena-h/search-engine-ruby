# Zendesk Coding Challenge

## Overview

Using the provided data (tickets.json and users.json and organization.json) write a simple
command line application to search the data and return the results in a human readable format.

* Feel free to use libraries or roll your own code as you see fit.
* Where the data exists, values from any related entities should be included in the results, i.e. searching organization by id should return its tickets and users.

* The user should be able to search on any field, full value matching is fine (e.g. "mar" won't
return "mary").

* The user should also be able to search for empty values, e.g. where description is empty.

Search can get pretty complicated pretty easily, we just want to see that you can code a basic but efficient search application. Ideally, search response times should not increase linearly as the number of documents grows. You can assume all data can fit into memory on a single
machine.

## EVALUATION CRITERIA
We will look at your project and assess it for:
1. Extensibility - separation of concerns.
2. Simplicity - aim for the simplest solution that gets the job done whilst remaining readable, extensible and testable.
3. Test Coverage - breaking changes should break your tests.
4. Performance - should gracefully handle a significant increase in amount of data provided (e.g 10000+ users).
5. Robustness - should handle and report errors.If you have any questions about this criteria please ask.

### SPECIFICATIONS
- Use the language in which you are strongest.
- Include a README with (accurate) usage instructions.
- Document the assumptions and tradeoffs you’ve made.
